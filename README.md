# Project Talent standard tasks

MVP Studio is an incubator for software start-ups. I am currently working on project Talent which is a web application that connects job seekers and employers, with the aim of creating a better recruitment experience.

**Stack:** JavaScript, React.JS, C#, ASP.NET MVC, MongoDB, Microservices.
